# PROMPT - Use case 1: Literature review summarization!

# Context: 
A development program is a structured initiative that is designed to enhance the skills, knowledge, and abilities of a predetermined group. These programs are implemented to achieve specific objectives for professional growth and organizational effectiveness. The primary goal is to facilitate learning and development in areas identified as important.

# Objective: 
Produce a summary in bullet point form synthesizing key insights from articles and research papers related to development programs, upskilling/reskilling, retention, and career development in the field of data science. The summary is designed to be used by a diverse audience at a National Statistical Agency, which includes human resource practitioners, statisticians, data scientists, mid-level and upper-level management, and other non-technical staff. The summary will be used to shape the development of a data science development program.
